Do not alter any part of the code.

Currently, when a user plays the game, their game progress is stored in localStorage for different scenarios, which is already implemented.

Reference Object:
{
    "id": "h5to4a33j",
    "player": "Justin",
    "joinedDate": "2025-02-11T02:52:04.532Z",
    "high_score": 6,
    "gameProgress": {
        "currentRound": 1,
        "currentScore": 0,
        "currentCategory": 4,
        "currentLives": 3,
        "wordsCompleted": []
    },
    "custom_words": [
        "KIWI",
        "APPLE",
        "MANGO",
        "GRAPE",
        "STRAWBERRY",
        "WATERMELON",
        "BANANA",
        "ORANGE",
        "BLUEBERRY"
    ],
    "default_words": [
        "BOOK",
        "LOVE",
        "FISH",
        "GAME",
        "PLAY",
        "HOME",
        "CODE",
        "TEXT",
        "WORD",
        "TREE",
        "SMILE",
        "MOUSE",
        "WATER",
        "TABLE"
    ]
}

Implementation Details:
We have a predefined set of words stored in word.js categorized into 7 categories (4-letter to 10-letter words, each containing 10 words).
The shuffleArray function provides a random word from the current category.

Issues to Fix:
1. Repeating Previously Answered Words on Returning Users
When a returning player enters their name (which is detected from localStorage), the game incorrectly displays 1 or 2 already answered words before proceeding to the next category.
For example, if a player correctly answers all 10 words from the 4-letter category (Score: 10), then refreshes the page and re-enters their name, the game should continue from the next category. However, currently, it repeats some previously answered words before moving on.

2. Incorrect Game Reset on "Play Again"
When the game ends and the user selects "Play Again," it should restart properly from the first category with all words before moving to the next.
Instead, after resetting, the game currently skips most words in the first category and moves to the next category prematurely.

This issue is reflected in the following object:
{
    "id": "h5to4a33j",
    "player": "Justin",
    "joinedDate": "2025-02-11T02:52:04.532Z",
    "high_score": 6,
    "gameProgress": {
        "currentRound": 2,
        "currentScore": 2,
        "currentCategory": 5,
        "currentLives": 3,
        "wordsCompleted": [
            "LOVE"
        ]
    }
}

Here, instead of starting with all words from the 4-letter category, the game showed only 1 word ("LOVE") and moved to the next category.

Fixing the Issue:
1. Ensure that when a user returns to the game, it fetches wordsCompleted from localStorage and continues from where they left off without repeating already answered words.
2. When "Play Again" is selected, ensure that all words from one category are shown before moving to the next category.
3. Track the length of the shuffled array dynamically.
- Once the length is met, increment the round.
- Calculate the next shuffle array length dynamically instead of assuming a static 10-word limit.
4. Implement logic to avoid repeating wordsCompleted from localStorage when continuing a game.
5. Modify round increment logic:
- Instead of static round progression, use the formula: abs(PlayedCategoryLength - RemainingCategoryLength)
- When this value reaches 0, increment the round.
6. If necessary, store additional details (PlayedCategoryLength / RemainingCategoryLength) to better track progress.
